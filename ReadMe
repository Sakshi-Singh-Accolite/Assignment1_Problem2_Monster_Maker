Problem 2
Monster maker:
In the world of Monsters every monster can have different traits.
The traits include features such as color of eyes, feather color, magical abilities,
size of the Monster, strength, durability, weakness, aggression level etc.
Users should be able to create their own monsters by answering simple questions
on traits by reading from standard input in java. When two monsters are created
by the user, create a baby Monster by coping traits from their parents randomly.
Baby monsters must be unique from the other monsters.
Hint : Use reflection in java to access the traits of the Monster. Use a Scanner to
read the Input
